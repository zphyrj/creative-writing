  "text": "The silence of the night rings out like a clock tower bell. It roars over my inner monologue leaving only my ability to feel.\n\nI have no retreat from the silence. It is always omnipresent, but presently it is amplified by the blanket of the black, starless, sky. I want to pound, to shout, to roar, and yet I do not; for the blanket stifles me, preventing me from breaking the stream of screaming silence.\n\nSounds from the day echo in my head. The silence prevents my ears from hearing new ones and the blanket of the night stops me from expelling the old ones outward.\n\nI am left with only echoes and emotions, and I want to scream, and yet I don't dare challenge the deafening silence that surrounds and swirls and swells around me. I wish I could shatter it and shout but I don't have the bravery to do so.\n\nI have to convince the sun to rise, so that the light may dissolve the stifling night away.",
